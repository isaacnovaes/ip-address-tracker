## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Animations
- IP Geolocation API
- Leaflet

### What I learned

It was grate practicing with async JS while working with 2 different APIs. Also, I have learned a little more about Leaflet, which is a well-known API used to display interactive maps.

### Useful resources

- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - This helped me for retrieving city, country, lat, and lng used in this project.
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - This helped me display the geographical location based od the lat and lng given by the IP Geolocation API
